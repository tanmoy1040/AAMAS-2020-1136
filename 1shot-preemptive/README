Paper name: Path Planning for Mobile Charging Stations in a Multi-Robot Environment
PREREQUISITES:
--------------
1. UNIX environment
2. g++
3. make
4. SMT solver Z3 (Installation link: https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3)

HOW TO RUN:
-----------
a) Assuming your current directory is "supplemental/<approach_name>".
   Move to directory  /examples

b) Following input files are needed in the "examples" directory:
     workspace.txt  obstacle.txt  2d_template.txt  rob1_traj.txt  rob2_traj.txt  rob3_traj.txt  rob4_traj.txt  rob5_traj.txt  rob6_traj.txt   

c) Execute   ./run.sh tool_z3

d) Output will appear on the console.

INPUT FILE DETAILS:
------------
Following input files contain input parameters to the program. Here, we mention the attributes of each input file.

1. workspace.txt
<max x coordinate>
<max y coordinate>
<no. of worker robots>
<original hyperloop length>
<max. recharge amount per unit time>
<no. of recharger robots>


2. rob1_traj.txt (contains worker-1 details, similar input files for other worker robots)
<full charge amount>
<no. of trajectory points>
<position of trajectory point 1>
<position of trajectory point 2> 
and so on ...
<charge cost for moving from point-1 to point-2>
<charge cost for moving from point-2 to point-3>
and so on ...


3. obstacle.txt contains obstacle grid positions (2-D)


4. 2d_template.txt contains motion primitive details
<primitive id>
<initial velocity>
<final velocity>
<displacement of [x, y] distance from current position>
<cost of applying this primitive>
<time required to apply this primitive>
<swath locations from the current location, while applied>

Similarly, details of other primitives are captured.
